`tls_certificate_check` is a library for Erlang/OTP and Elixir that
tries to make it easier to establish [more secure HTTPS
connections](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=CA/IncludedCertificates&redirect=no)
in ordinary setups.

Other kinds of TLS/SSL connections may also benefit from it.

It blends a CA trust store with
[ssl\_verify\_fun](https://github.com/deadtrickster/ssl_verify_fun.erl)
to verify remote hostnames,
as well as the boilerplate to validate [misordered
certificate chains](https://github.com/elixir-mint/mint/issues/95).

The
[OTP-trusted CAs](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/public_key.html#cacerts_get-0)
(typically provided by the OS) are used on OTP 25+ unless unavailable or opted-out[^1],
in which case `tls_certificate_check` falls back to a hardcoded [Mozilla's CA certificate
store](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html), as extracted by `curl`.
When on OTP 24 or older, the lib will initialize using only the latter.

The trusted authorities' certificates are loaded when the application
starts and made available to the API through
[`persistent_term`](https://erlang.org/doc/man/persistent_term.html)[^2]. After that, they can
be explicitly overridden through the API.

### How to use

#### Erlang

##### 1\. Import as a dependency

rebar.config

``` erlang
{deps, [
    % [...]
    {tls_certificate_check, "~> 1.28"}
]}.
```

your\_application.app.src

``` erlang
{applications, [
    kernel,
    stdlib,
    % [...]
    tls_certificate_check
]}
```

##### 2\. Make your connections safer

``` erlang
Host = "example.com",
Options = tls_certificate_check:options(Host),
ssl:connect(Host, 443, Options, 5000)
```

#### Elixir

##### 1\. Import as a dependency

mix.exs

``` elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      # [...]
      {:tls_certificate_check, "~> 1.28"}
    ]
  end
```

##### 2\. Make your connections safer

``` elixir
host = "example.com"
options = :tls_certificate_check.options(host)
host |> String.to_charlist() |> :ssl.connect(443, options, 5000)
```

### Advanced Use

#### Overriding Trusted CAs

##### Erlang

```erlang
Path = certifi:cacertfile(),
tls_certificate_check:override_trusted_authorities({file, Path})
```

##### Elixir

```elixir
path = CAStore.file_path()
:tls_certificate_check.override_trusted_authorities({:file, path})
```

### API Reference

The API reference can be found on
[HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/tls_certificate_check/).

### Tested setup

[^1]: the use of OTP-trusted CAs can be controlled through the `use_otp_trusted_CAs` boolean
option within application env config.

[^2]: the persistent term key is derived from the CA store's own contents and existing keys
are not erased until the app terminates gracefully - this minimizes the risk of an impactful
global garbage collection.
